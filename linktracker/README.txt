You can either use the web installer inside "installer" folder to install it.
or you can manually do it.




Web Installer will:

	+Setup MySQL tables.
	+Setup Configuration File.

it will do everything required to run this.

tested with PHP and MySQL (5.5)

Thank you for downloading the SLT "Simple Link Tracker" with PHP and MySQL.

in order for the installer to work it has to be inside the app folder!
