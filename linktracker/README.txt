You can either use the web installer inside "installer" folder to install it.
or you can manually do it.




Web Installer will:

	+Setup MySQL tables.
	+Setup Configuration File.

it will do everything required to run this.

tested with PHP and MySQL (5.5)

don't forget to signup to my updates, I will probably be updating this script sometime soon,
so when you're signed up you will receive a direct download link to your email.


Thank you for downloading the SLT "Simple Link Tracker" with PHP and MySQL.

in order for the installer to work it has to be inside the app folder!
and if you're placing linktracker inside a subfolder then you must edit class/config and insert it manually later.
